# FCC Time Calculator Project ðŸ•’

This is my **Time Calculator** project for the freeCodeCamp **Scientific Computing with Python** certification.

## ðŸ”§ Project Description

The `add_time()` function takes in:

- A start time (in 12-hour AM/PM format)
- A duration (in hours and minutes)
- An optional starting weekday (case-insensitive)

It returns the updated time after adding the duration, including:

- Proper AM/PM rollover
- Next day or `(n days later)` labeling
- Correct weekday if one is provided
